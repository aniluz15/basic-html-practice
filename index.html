        <h4> How we met :D</h4>
        <p>My favorite hobby is hanging out with my friend group and my boyfriend Noah. My friend group is comprised of everyone at least
        knowing someone from elementry school. Our original friend group has 6 people: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Aidan</li>
            <li>Kaley</li>
            <li>Jack</li>
            <li>Ellie</li>
            <li>Savannah</li>
            <li>Me :) </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Me, Jack, Aidan, and Savannah went to the same elementry school and when we went to middle school we met Kaley and Ellie who 
            went to the same different school. Coincidently, my now boyfriend Noah was bestfriends with Kaley in elementry school.</p></div>

        <h3>Throughout 6 years</h3>
        <p>Throughout 6 years of the 6 of us being friends, we have gotten into <strong><em>countless</em></strong> arguments, fights, periods of time some people 
            didn't speak to each other but in the end we always came back to one another. Despite Jack and Savannah moving away in August of 2021 and Feburary of 2022
            we all still remain friends and still text each other regularly. </p>
        <ol>Jack moved in August of 2021 and since then I have visited him twice and he has come back twice.
            <li>I flew by myself at 15 to go visit Jack and his family in Colorado in December 2021 for the first time. 
                It was the first time I had seen him in months and it was an experience I will never forget since I had never been to 
                Colorado before. I missed my flight and had to leave 3 days later than planned but it was still an amazing experience.
            </li>
            <li>He came back for the first time in the summer of 2022 and it was the first time everyone was able to hang out as a group again.
                When he came back it was very fun and we all went to Santa Cruz as a group for my birthday. We were all very sad when he had to leave
                but knew we would see him again.
            </li>
            <li>The next winter in December of 2022 I went to Colorado by myself again to visit him and it was by far my favorite time I had gone over the first time.
                Me and his little brother Blake are also very close and it was a lot of fun all three of us playing in the snow and jamming out in the car
                to music. I didn't miss my flight this time.
            </li>
            <li> This recent summer in August of 2023 he came back for 4 days and we hung out as a group and was also able to meet my now boyfriend Noah. 
                They got along really well. We all hung out as a group for 4 days before me and Jack went to Las Vegas for almost a week. It was our first
                longer distance trip together and we had a blast. He flew home from Las Vegas
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>We are currently are going to try and plan for me to fly back to Colorado in Janurary of 2024.</p>
        <ol> Savannah moved away in Feburary of 2022 and has visited once since.
            <li>In June of 2022, Savannah came back for a month. Almost every day everyone would be at my house just hanging out. It was so much fun.
                We would walk to the Starbucks near my house, play Monopoly in my room, watch movies, etc. Overall it was so much fun. I miss her a lot.
            </li>
            <li> She currently has a flight scheduled to visit us in December and we are all really excited to see her again. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>We all still hang out with each other to this day. They are my bestfriends and I will always love them no matter what. 
            <strong>They mean a lot to me and I try to always prioritize them.</strong>

    <h3>Meeting Noah</h3>
    <p>I met Noah here at CART last year in 2022. We were in the same break friend group. He started hanging out with me and Kaley in 
        March of 2023 and on April 15th we started dating. He and Kaley were bestfriends in elementry school so they quickly became good 
        friends again. 
    </p>
    <h3>Our Dates</h3>
    <p> The story of our first actual date is kind of funny since I had met his parents and grandparents before our first official date.
        His mom had invited me to hangout at his grandparents house down the street from mine and so while we hungout there and I got to meet his family,
        our first official date we had gone to dinner at Lazy Dog in River Park and had walked around River Park. We played Arcade Games at Conney Island and
        we went to Target where he bought me a Snorlax stuffed animal he knew I had wanted when we would go to Target after school previously.
    </p>
    <p>From then on we were <strong>always</strong> together. We would attend family gatherings together and would go on little mini-dates afterschool.
        When summer had started, we would make it a point to see each other at least once a week. We would often go to Wild Waters since we both had season passes.
        It was always a lot of fun. Our first week of summer we went to the beach together for the first time with his family. After that we would often hangout
        with each other at the others houses. One of our at-home dates we baked a cake with his little brothers who are 3 and 5, it was fun dancing in the kitchen and 
        eating the frosting before the cake was even out of the oven. We celebrated our birthdays in August together where I took him to see a movie and lunch and he surprised me by
        taking me to Build a Bear and lunch.
    </p>
    <p>This year, though it is harder to go on dates afterschool we still try and spend time outside of school whenever we can. He hangs out with me and my friend group
        now and it makes me happy that my friends get along with him. :)
